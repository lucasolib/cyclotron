# Cyclotron Exercise

This repository is a exercise about a function that returns the ideal matrix to the specific particle.

## API Documentation

#### Cyclotron Function

The cyclotron function requires two parameters, the first one is the particle that you want to acelerate. The second one is the size of the matrix that you want!

This function should return how the acceleration would look inside the matrix!
